This sketch was originated from an example of Eclipse Paho Arduino MQTT library.
You can download the library from the site below.

https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/paho/arduino_1.0.0.zip

You will get arduino_1.0.0.zip containing MQTT library developed by IBM.
To install it to Arduino IDE, use "Add . ZIP library" in "Include Library" on the "Sketch" menu.

When you install it successfully, you can see "MQTT Clinet" in "Examples". 
After confirming it, download this sketch and compile it and upload your image to Spresense with LTE-M Board.

Note:
The test site of "iot.eclipse.org" is no longer available, so I replaced the site to "test.mosquitto.org"
